# 🤖 Rover-Robotic Arm

A Wi-Fi controlled **Rover Robotic Arm** built using **ESP32 microcontoller**, **DC Motors**, **Servo Motors**, **3D Printed Components** and **other mentioned components**.The project combines a mobile robotic 4 wheeled rover with a multi-degree-of-freedom robotic arm capable of object handling, industrial purposes, navigation, and real-time remote control through a web-based interface. This project has been developed with the assistance of various academic and online resources, including tutorials and reference materials, which have been carefully studied, analysed, and implemented by us in our own understanding.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

### Rover Movement

The ESP32 sends control signals to the L298N motor driver, which controls the DC motors responsible for rover movement.

Supported movements:

- Forward
- Backward
- Left
- Right
- Stop

### Robotic Arm Control

Servo motors provide precise control of:

- Base Rotation
- Shoulder Joint
- Elbow Joint
- Wrist Joint
- Gripper Mechanism

### Wireless Communication

The ESP32 creates its own Wi-Fi network and hosts a web dashboard. Users connect to the network and control the rover through a browser.
